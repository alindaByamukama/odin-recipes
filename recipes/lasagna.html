<h2>Description</h2>    

<p>
    This Vegatarian Lasagna, is like any other simple home made lasgna - except we shall be replacing the usual meat based filling with spinach, mushrooms and zuccini.
    Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. 
    It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. 
    After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.
